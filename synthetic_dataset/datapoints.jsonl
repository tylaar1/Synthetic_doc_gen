{"charge_type": "landing_fee", "document": "# Alpine Fjord Airport Charging Policy Document\n\nAlpine Fjord Airport is committed to providing a comprehensive and transparent fee structure to ensure a seamless and efficient aviation experience for all users. This document, Alpine Fjord Airport Charging Policy, is an official policy document outlining the airport's fee structure and charging policies for aviation services, effective as of the date of publication. The following information is intended to provide clarity on the airport's charges and fees, which are subject to change and may be updated from time to time.\n\n## Security Fee Charges for Passengers and Airlines at Alpine Fjord Airport\n\nThe Excess Luggage Charge is applied to checked and unchecked luggage exceeding the standard weight allowance. This charge is calculated based on the weight of the luggage in kilograms. The rate is tiered to reflect varying levels of excess baggage.\n\nThe charge is calculated as follows: a luggage weight of 5.0 to 12.0 kilograms incurs a charge equal to twice the weight, a weight of 12.0 to 45.3 kilograms incurs a charge equal to the weight, and any weight above 45.3 kilograms incurs no additional charge. This tiered structure aims to provide a reasonable and fair approach to managing excess luggage at Alpine Fjord Airport.\n\n## Landing Fee Schedule and Charges for Alpine Fjord Airport\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; width: 100%;\">\n  <caption style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Landing Fee Charges by Flight Class</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><strong>Fuel Burn Range (Gallons)</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Domestic Rate</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>International Rate</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Charter Rate</strong></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>500.00 \u2013 1040.10</td>\n      <td>3.0 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n      <td>3.3 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n      <td>3.6 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1040.10 \u2013 2025.40</td>\n      <td>2.0 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n      <td>2.2 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n      <td>2.4 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2025.40 \u2013 4144.70</td>\n      <td>1.0 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n      <td>1.1 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n      <td>1.2 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4144.70 \u2013 5000.00</td>\n      <td>0.0 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n      <td>0.0 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n      <td>0.0 \u00d7 fuel burn</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Fuel Tax Charges and Assessment at Alpine Fjord Airport\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; width: 100%;\">\n  <caption style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Fuel Tax Charges by Flight Category and Aircraft Weight</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><strong>Aircraft Weight Range (Pounds)</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Domestic Rate</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>International Rate</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Charter Rate</strong></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5000.00 \u2013 207460.80</td>\n      <td>0.0 \u00d7 plane weight</td>\n      <td>0.0 \u00d7 plane weight</td>\n      <td>0.0 \u00d7 plane weight</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>207460.80 \u2013 400000.00</td>\n      <td>1.0 \u00d7 plane weight</td>\n      <td>1.1 \u00d7 plane weight</td>\n      <td>1.2 \u00d7 plane weight</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Baggage Fee Policy: Charges for Excess, Oversized, and Special Items\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; width: 100%;\">\n  <caption style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Baggage Charges by Mass</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><strong>Baggage Mass Range (kg)</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Charge</strong></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>0.00 \u2013 5.00</td>\n      <td>1 \u00d7 baggage mass</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5.00 \u2013 25.10</td>\n      <td>0 \u00d7 baggage mass</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Passenger Service Fee Charges\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; width: 100%;\">\n  <caption style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Aircraft Type Charges</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><strong>Aircraft Type</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Charge</strong></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Military</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Passenger</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Cargo</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Private</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Airport Facility Fee Charges for Alpine Fjord Airport\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; width: 100%;\">\n  <caption style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Aircraft Type Charges</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><strong>Aircraft Type</strong></th>\n      <th><strong>Charge</strong></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Private</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Passenger</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Military</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Cargo</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nThe charging policy of Alpine Fjord Airport is designed to ensure transparency and fairness in the provision of aviation services.
