## Security Fee Charges for Passengers and Airlines at Alpine Fjord Airport

The Excess Luggage Charge is applied to checked and unchecked luggage exceeding the standard weight allowance. This charge is calculated based on the weight of the luggage in kilograms. The rate is tiered to reflect varying levels of excess baggage.

The charge is calculated as follows: a luggage weight of 5.0 to 12.0 kilograms incurs a charge equal to twice the weight, a weight of 12.0 to 45.3 kilograms incurs a charge equal to the weight, and any weight above 45.3 kilograms incurs no additional charge. This tiered structure aims to provide a reasonable and fair approach to managing excess luggage at Alpine Fjord Airport.
